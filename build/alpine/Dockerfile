# Requires docker >= 17.05 (requires support for multi-stage builds)
# Requires to have created the wire-server-builder and wire-server-deps docker images (run `make` in this directory)
# Usage example:
#   (from wire-server root directory)
#   SERVICE=galley; docker build -f build/alpine/Dockerfile -t $SERVICE --build-arg service=$SERVICE .

#--- Builder stage ---
FROM wire-server-builder:alpine as builder

ARG service
COPY . /src/wire-server/

RUN cd /src/wire-server/services/${service} && make install

RUN apk add --no-cache \
        python \
        py-pip && \
    pip install jinja2-cli[yaml]

# ARGs are not available at runtime, use a j2 template to write an entrypoint specific to this service.
# As the bash script uses exec, we can see which service is run as PID 1
